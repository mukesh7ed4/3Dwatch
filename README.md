3D Watch Experience with Portal Effect


This project is a dynamic 3D visualization of watches built using React Three.js, 
React Three Fiber, and React Drei.
Users can explore the detailed 3D models of watches with an immersive portal
effect that allows interaction with the model, including zooming, rotating, and more.

1. Project Overview
The 3D Watch Experience provides a unique way for users to interact with 3D models of watches.
 Clicking on the portal transports users inside the watch model,
 where they can explore the details by zooming in, rotating, and interacting in real-time.
 This project showcases the capabilities of React Three.js combined with React Three Fiber for rendering complex 3D graphics in the browser.

2. Key Features

3D Watch Models:
Three high-quality, detailed 3D models of watches are featured.

Portal Effect:
A portal interaction that allows users to "enter" the 3D model.
Upon clicking the portal, users can zoom, rotate, and freely explore the 3D watch.

Real-Time Interaction:
Full support for user input to control the model, including zooming, rotation, and dragging.
Smooth, real-time updates for a seamless interactive experience.

Responsive Design:
The 3D interface is responsive and works across devices, offering a great user experience on both desktop and mobile.


Technology Stack
React.js: Used for building the user interface.
React Three.js: Provides the core 3D rendering functionality.
React Three Fiber: React-based wrapper for Three.js to easily manage 3D scenes.
React Drei: Utility components for Three.js that simplify the setup of lighting, cameras, and portals.
CSS: Simple CSS for basic styling and layout.
